Now that you’ve completed the time allotted to your personal project, how does it match up with your expectations? If you thought it’d be super hard, was it? If you thought you’d move incredibly quickly, did you?

I thought that the individual project would be very challenging but also a great opportunity to learn, and thats exactly what it was. I set a pretty ambitious goal to achieve in the 10 or so day project, learn a new technology and implement it. I didnt quite get it done in the time allowed of to the standard that I hoped to achieve but I got pretty close. The original idea was to pull in all your friends and followers from Twitter and then visualise them graphically, with the ability to find the shortest path to a certain person in the network. I got to the point where there were nodes visualised on screen but not further. Hopefully I can continue on with the development of it and see where it gets me.

If you are going to continue development, how are you planning to keep yourself dedicated to the goal?

I have not decided whether to keep developing the project into my last individual project. I think there are definitely some cool things that can be done with the app, such as further social media integrations and visualisations but whether it can be done in the time allowed I am not so sure. Im happy that I had an idea, and that for the most part it was to some degree successfully implemented. As a developer I think I am at the stage where if I am having difficulty implementing something, I know how to go about finding the right information on how to do it. Or I know how to find someone that can help me learn how to do it. In that sense I feel pretty independent and happy with where I am technically at this point in the gschool program.
