<h1>Passionate Programmer Reading<h1> 
<hr />--------------------------------------<hr />

Was there a tip that rung true with your past experience in a field other than programming? How was it similar?
Was there a tip that you disagreed with? How/why?
Some of the tips seem obvious, but what was one that surprised you?
Which tip would be the hardest for you to implement and why? What systems/support can you use to make it work?

Do you think there’s a difference between being a "coder", a "programmer", a "developer", and an "architect"? What kind of role is the author pushing you towards? What do you actually want to be?
Endurance athletes are at their peak after age 30. What age range do you think is the peak performance for programmers? How do the author’s tips inform your thinking?
Do you know another spoken language besides English? If not, why? If so, how does it affect/inform/degrade your English? How do you think this relates to programming languages?


>>>>>Some of the tips seem obvious, but what was one that surprised you?

> Specialisation V generalisation, some counter opinion to what usually told


Theme of awareness
> awareness of minute importance and the need to remain competitive

>	A passage of the book talked about the importance of role models and how having someone that you depend on should not be seen as a sign of weakness. This isnt surprising to me, however it makes me more aware of a reluctance I have to ask for help sometimes .This parallels with the setup in gSchool. A part of me is reluctant to ask questions becasue
	I dont want to seem stupid!
	I want to prove to myself that I can do it
	I dont want others to think Im asking for a handout of free knowledge
But the cool thing about the group is that everyone is in the same boat so the collaborative learning doesnt feel like a weakness, it feels like a communal advantage. I guess in this way we all get to act as role models for eachother, and everyone is better off. 

> The tip to create urgency surprised me a bit. This book is the first one to put a name on something that Ive been aware of for a while: parkinsons law - where your work expands to the time allotted. Im sure we have all experienced the magic effect a time constraint can have on productivity. Knocking out something in a day that usually takes 5 is always a cool feeling. What I take from the tip to create urgency is that there is more control over our levels of productivity than maybe we sometime admit, and that if we were to practice actively seeking urgency through better organisation, planning etc. it could have a marked effect on our own output and help us achieve more. Seek urgency and dont get comfortable was the guts of what I took from that

> Hit list and my post-it nuggets, plan out my day, break tasks down into small achievable steps, write them on little sticky postits and put them on the edge of my monitor. When I do one I get to take it off the monitor and stuck it on the nugget wall. The postits are coloured aswell so that I can rank by importance and make sure that at the end of the day I have a balanced number and rank of achieved nuggets. It grows over time so it provides good motivation and perspective.
