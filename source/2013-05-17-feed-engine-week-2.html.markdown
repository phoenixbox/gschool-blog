## FeedEngine

### What have been the tough parts so far?

This has been the first project with exposure to interacting with API's. In spite of the vast documentation available for all the services I find there are still some usual pitfalls with authentication etc. So I guess thats just the nature of a evolving piece of code, some things change along the way. This seems particularly true of Twitter, little nucaced changes can cause a bit of implementation down time but I think this will not be so bad in the future when we become more versed in third party API interaction in general.

### Whatâ€™s the plan for the next six days?

Our implementation has not progressed as fast as we had hoped so we are going to trim down our feature spec and build what we think will be feasible in the remaining time that we have. This is disappointing becasue I do not like to miss the mark on the original specs but I also want us a s group to deliver a quality product in the end that I can be a part of exhibiting on or demo day.

### What is it going to be like when you finish?

I will be back to Ireland for 7 weeks after the course, during which I will continue learning as much as I can and taking time to go over the core material covered in the course. I will begin a personal project that incorporates the learning and will broach some new implementations that I want to execute. It will probably be a very important time for me, I think it will be a great time to solidfy some of the learnings over the past 6 months. It will be nice to see my family etc as well.
