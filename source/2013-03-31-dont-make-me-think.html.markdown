### This book is ancient in technology-years. Is it still relevant? What feels dated and what feels on point?

I think the majority of the user psychology is still relevant. Perhaps a slightly outdated comment in the book was that web business models come and go like buses. Everyone has had their auction and daily deals sites etc. which have had a transient value for most but there is no doubt that many of the e-commerce business models have solidifed their legitimacy for revenue generation more so than many had at the time of the writing of dont make me think. So same same but different.

Most of the standard user behaviour seems to be on point. Possibly click through navigation has lost some of its "first discovery" importance. I usually head straight to the search bar and judge a site based based on how close the results match my intended query. From that point I might venutre into the navigation elements, but for the majority of the time I live on the search bar. Krug mentioned that often the browser will blame themselves first for a poor site experience, I think that the modern internet user would shoulder less of the blame for poor site experience becasue the use of the web has become so commonplace. The internet is no longer special, there are more demands placed upon the creators of the web experience and, I think, less tolerance for missing expectations.

### Was there an idea that particularly clicked for you?

Navigation had something that clicked for me. The idea that navigation is as important for when the user needs a reference point whilst experienceing the site is something I guess I had taken for granted. It has been easy for me to think that navigation is just a map that you get at the start of the maze, whereas good naviation should have locational reference points within the maze which gives the user perspective. The litmus test for naviation might be putting a user in an obscure part of the maze and seeing how easy they find it to navigate from A-B. I guess there was nothing hugely new to me but more a different way of looking at things. Also the idea of opportunity click cost was somewhat of an ah-ha moment. If there is little punitive cost it might be harder to predict how the user will traverse the experience you have created.

### Was there a concept or recommendation you disagreed with?

There is nothing too controversial in the book to completely disagree with. All the ideas are guiding principles not explicit instructions on how things should be done so its a take what you will scenario.


### What did you learn from "Street Signs & Breadcrumbs" (Chapter 6)?

I guess the main thing that I took from this chapter was the need to be user-centric in design for navigation at all levels of the experience. Its not enough to design for shallow navigation because the user might spend most of their time in the deeeper sections of the website and if these sections are not easy to navigate then the whole experience is ruined.


### How did/will lessons from the book influence your current project?

The squint and trunk test are the two techniques I think I could implement easiest. I think the trunk test in particular is a real test of whether a user can actually navigate the site easily and have the experience that we have set out. I think our project members would do well to turn our project over to the other students to see how the experience the site and what obstacles they encounter.
