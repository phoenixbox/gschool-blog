For this project I am back with my group from the last team project. I get on very well with everyone in the group so Im quite happy with it. We all work well together so hopefully we will knock out a good project. Our last one together was very well received by all during our public demos so Im optimisitic about this one.

I understand the concept of services but Im not sure of all the wiring that is necessary yet. Same as always, it will take the first project to understand the goings on behind the scenes, but I am looking forward to it.

Websockets with Faye is not something that I have tackled yet. Strictly speaking it is not part of my responsibilities for the project but nevertheless I will try to implement it in my non-project spare time so that I can understand everything that is going on. It seems challenging but I think there will be a lot of good content to learn.

On the job frontier I had an interview with an NYC based company called Cardflight. They were cool guys, located in a city that I would love to live in, working in a space in a way that I think is quite clever and which they will do quite well with. I think it is an environment within which I could grow, being exposed to a company that will likely grow quite rapidly. I let myself down on the technical interview, and it was not that I didnt know the answers it was more a case of just fumbling an interview question so that was disappointing. Lesson learned is that experience in the interview process is needed I guess. Learn by do.

My next steps to finding a good job are cleaning up my repos. Cleaning up my portfolio, possibly porting all my content to a better formed blog which communicates my design skills as well as my coding skills. I always take notes of my experiences when coding and I feel I should translate them to blog posts that communicate my understanding of things and my efforts to learn new topics. I recently put together a substantial document on my project involving neo4j so I will look to transpose some of that content to my blog.

There is not much that has turned me off from potential employers thus far. There seem to be a lot of great opportunities out there for all of us at gschool
