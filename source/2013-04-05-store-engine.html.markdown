## First Project Demo Done

This week saw us finish our first gschool projects. My group made it to the final 4 so we got to present to the Galvanize community which was pretty cool if not a little daunting. First impressions count so I hoped that we would do a good job presenting. Personally I was quite proud of what we put together in the the 2 weeks we had for the project. My skill set from my design background definitely helped communicate the value of our work. We ended up winning overall, by virtue of the community members whom had come to watch the presentations so that was a nice way to end the project.

#### What did you learn about Rails during StoreEngine?

After this project I think I have a good handle on the MVC framework. Closer to the end, I was getting a better understanding of the best practices with respect to the construciton of views and models etc. At first I was including a lot of logic in the views, which transitioned into a better workflow of extracting logic in to model methods and partials etc. We definitely covered a lot of ground with this project! A retrospective of it will solidify some the learnings but overall I felt alot more comfortable at the keyboard than I had in weeks gone by.

#### How does that shape your plan for the next project?

My plan for the next project is to have done a thorough retrospective of store engine so that I can again join the dots of how everything is stitched together. Included in that retrospective is a review of the testing we did. I think the main barrier for me with creating the testing suite was an unfamiliarity with syntax. Having flip-flopped between MiniTest and rSpec over the last few weeks and including Capybara, there has been alot of different syntax things to get used to. Im hoping to go through the everyday rails book I have, to review the different rspec testing methodologies for controllers etc.

#### What did you learn about working in a larger team during StoreEngine? 

My group was great. We went at a quick enough pace for it to be challenging but not so fast that we were not thorough in our testing and development. We mob programmed the whole time. The inital concern with this was that possibly we could have gone faster on our own but this was not the case I dont think. It seemed to work as we were chosen as the best store in the end.

#### What things will you do the same or different during the next project?

I think in the next project I would like to mix mob programming with some individual work. I think I need to push myself to be able to sit down and construct code with value on my own.

#### Do you feel like your team was 50-100% more productive 
than a two-person team? 

I would say our 3 man team which mob programmed was about 75% more productive than a 2 man team.

#### Did "Donâ€™t Make Me Think" influence decisions as your were building your app? Why or why not? When other people used your application, what did you notice?

I think the book influenced our efforts to create a friendly user interface which had some well established visual segmentation so that the users attention was drawn to the right places. I think for the most part, people who used our site, interacted with it in the way we had anticipated they would based on our design thinking. Our search was not great, but people seemed to like the voice search element. All credit to Blair
