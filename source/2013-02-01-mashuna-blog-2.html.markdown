##Thoughts on Chad Fowler's Book
***

###Was there a tip that rung true with your past experience in a field other than programming? How was it similar?

####Specialisation V Generalisation
This is something that rings true with my business studies in college. The same sentiment behind the saying "A jack of all trades,master of none" was echoed within college by students and lecturers alike. My studies completely avoided any practical programming curriculum and real understanding of technology. The mindset was to leave the tech to the tech guys and the business to the business guys, which is obviously a load of bullshit because the two go hand in hand. Their preference towards a narrower domain experience is something that I don't agree with, and I think at the very least its just a manifestation of laziness. These kind of thinkers couldn't be bothered integrated the two because it would take too much effort. In the book, Fowler advocates actively seeking a broader technology domain experience and understanding the business side of a company too. I think thats the right attitude to have, so that sentiment rings true with me

####The Hit list
This tip is similar to a little thing I do called post-it nuggets. I would plan out my day, break tasks down into small achievable steps, write them on little sticky postits and put them on the edge of my monitor. When I do one I get to take it off the monitor and stuck it on the nugget wall. The postits are coloured coded so that I can rank by importance and make sure that at the end of the day I have a balanced number and rank of achieved nuggets. The nugget wall grows over time so it provides good motivation and perspective.

###Some of the tips seem obvious, but what was one that surprised you?

####Role Model
A passage of the book talked about the importance of role models and how having someone that you depend on should not be seen as a sign of weakness. This isnt surprising to me, however it makes me more aware of a reluctance I have to ask for help sometimes .This parallels with the setup in gSchool. A part of me is reluctant to ask questions because:

* I dont want to seem stupid!
* I want to prove to myself that I can do it
* I dont want others to think Im asking for a handout of free knowledge

But the cool thing about the group is that everyone is in the same boat so the collaborative learning doesnt feel like a weakness, it feels like a communal advantage. I guess in this way we all get to act as role models for eachother, and everyone is better off. 

####Creating Urgency
The tip to create urgency surprised me a bit. This book is the first one to put a name on something that Ive been aware of for a while: parkinsons law - where your work expands to the time allotted. Im sure we have all experienced the magic effect a time constraint can have on productivity. Knocking out something in a day that usually takes 5 is always a cool feeling. What I take from the tip to create urgency is that there is more control over our levels of productivity than maybe we sometime admit, and that if we were to practice actively seeking urgency through better organisation, planning etc. it could have a marked effect on our own output and help us achieve more. Seek urgency and dont get comfortable was the guts of what I took from that

###Theme of awareness
I think there is a common theme of awareness that runs through the book. A lot of the content is about taking ownership of domain experience, being self-sufficient, creating a sense urgency etc. It all seems to come from an effort to be more aware of your current direction and the need to take corrective action to maintain a course towards an achievable end. Again, its all the seemingly obvious stuff but its hard to do unless you make a concerted effort to make yourself aware of what needs to be done to get to the goal of your best self and stay there.
