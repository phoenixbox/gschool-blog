My mentor for the first mentorship round is Cory who works for Groupon. Cory already volunteers some of his time to come to gSchool every Tuesday to help out with nay questions that the students might have so I think Im quite lucky to have someone who is already willing to teach to be my mentor. I very much believe that teaching is an acquired skill, one which is not achieved easily and where the teacher also has to be a willing student. Cory has actually been on travel duty with work I believe so we have not had a chance to touch base apart from a few back and forth emails. However we have scheduled a pairing session for next friday evening which is great. It says alot about him that he is willing to spend his Friday evening teaching me. Next Friday is the day after our son of store engine submission and the day of a lightning talk for me so no doubt I will have reduced brain capacity Friday evening! I have had a group session with Cory before, and have found him to be a pretty good teacher so Im looking forward to the session. I think Cory can provide some clarity on certain aspects of Rails from a perspective of someone who works with the framework on a day to day basis. I think he will provide me with a lot of valuable real world insights.

The larger group for the SOSE project is not much different so far. We have been mobbing alot up to now, getting the store routes set up with different carts so I think that has been a good collective learning experience. I anticipate that the weekend will bring some more pairing work and individual work. I look forward to getting some experience with the design of the site. One of my group memebers is Kyle who has a decent knowledge of CSS and jQuery so Im hoping to pick up some implementation methodlogies from him.

Looking at someone else's code base is constantly surprising. Initially its almost as if its written in a different langauge. It gradually becomes more familiar but it still feels foreign. The hardest thing to get started with was the idea of what the specs wanted to create. The idea of a shopify clone was heavily emphasised accross the groups as it seems everyone needed a root idea to work from, but I think this emphasis comes with a lot of restrictions. I dont think that many groups will attempt to implement a unique take on the idea of a multitenancy app becasue its easy to base it off a root of Shopify and the develpment timeline is so truncated that there seems like there is little time for innovation. My group is working towards a scenario where we have a few shops with different carts and checkouts fully functional and then we are going to wrap that in the platform interface that enables users of the platform to create a store. Much in the same vein as shopify.

In my last project, we mob prorammed the whole time so I got to experience every role possible. I dont think this project will be much different but I think there will be more autonomy in executing different tasks. Kinda like an individual hot seat of roles instead of a collective hotseat.

The confusing parts of Rails are the probably the routes and the best practice for debugging when things go wrong. Often the hardest part is knowing where to start to look for the broken things. Something I rarely use is logger.debug within my code. I think it could be something useful to show the sequence of execution of code from which I can check the logs to see if things are being fired when they are meant to be.
