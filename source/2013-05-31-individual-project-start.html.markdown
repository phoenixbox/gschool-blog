This week is our first individual project, my idea is to visualise social relationships and then in an ideal scenario map the most efficient route to another user in the extended network. I wanted to take a step towards answering, if I wanted to get introduced to Elon Musk how would I go about it? We can all instantaneously contact eachother in the twitter/facebook/linkedin spehere but without that trusted reference point of a personal introduction the chances of an actual relationship being established are much slimmer. A simple tweet with the #elonmusk tag in it is unlikely to establish a legimate relationship between us, but if I can figure out how to get a personal introduction by establishing who it is I should connect with in order to get a personal intro then my chances of a legitimate relationship are higher. Thats the idea anyway, if I can wrangle the MVP out of neo4j graph databases then I will be pretty happy. I could have just create a normal railsy app, but screw that

## Now that you’ve been working on your own for a week, how does it match up with your expectations?

Its as I thought it would be, a sobering experience. In groups you have a collective intelligence with which you can apply to the problem and a diverse skill set that should equal more than the sum of parts etc. As part of thr individual project I knew that I would have to touch all bases, which is fine, its a great learning experience. This is a bit of a graduation project, in that if I can do it I will consider myself a programmer

If you thought it’d be super hard, was it?

Its as hard as you make it. My project will be using technologies that are a little obscure in the beginner realm so it will be interesting to see what I come up with. Its definetly pushing me so thats good

Given that you’ve defined an MVP and are almost halfway through, do you feel like you’ve gotten half of the work done?

I do not have half the work done because the majority of the time spent so far has been getting familiar with neo4j. Im not there yet. It will be a long weekend, but I will get it done and I will be able to present it with a core theory in mind that I'm confident to stand behind.

Working on your own, do you feel like you’re spending more time stuck on problems or are you more likely to ask for help?

I feel like Im spending more time struggling on my own, but I whink I need it. This project will definitely have some painful yards to gain in it, but its necessary for progress. At the end of this project I will feel more like I have been the lead implementor of the idea which will be great. Its no secret that our teams have been structured so far with a tech lead in the form of a more experienced prgrammer leading weaker programmers. I am not at the top of the class but Im lightyears beyond what I was initially as a complete command line noob. I am no longer a weak programmer, and this project will prove to me most importantly that I can think of something and then sit at a keyboard and implement it
